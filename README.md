# Rumor Web Interface

Rumor is a personal project of mine to create a collabrative RPG maker.  Users will be able to create maps, and eventually play them.

You can see this code in action.  I have a live demo here:  https://create.webrpg.dev


# Installation

To install, check out the project and run:

```
npm install
```
